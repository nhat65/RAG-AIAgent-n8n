ðŸ”„ VectorDB Flow: Real-time Product Sync
To ensure data consistency between the main product system and the chatbotâ€™s knowledge, a dedicated VectorDB Flow is implemented. This flow performs the following functions:

Monitors the main product database for real-time updates (e.g., product changes, additions, or removals).

Automatically indexes or re-indexes updated product data into the Supabase Vector Store (products_docs).

Enables the chatbot to retrieve and answer questions using fresh, consistent, and relevant product information every time a customer asks.

This ensures that the chatbot is always aligned with the latest catalog â€” reducing misinformation and improving customer trust.
